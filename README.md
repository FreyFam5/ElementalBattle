# Elemental Battle

Hello! Welcome to elemental battle!

I made this personal project for boot.dev, I always liked making games so I decided to make a two player terminal turn-based game(or TPTTBG for short ;))

This project can be copied and used by following these steps:

- Make sure you have python3 version 12+ installed along with your favorite IDE
- Go to the green "Code" button and click it
- Click "download zip"
- Open the file in your preferred IDE
- Then type "python3 main.py" in the terminal
- Then you should see a prompt in your terminal to type in the first players name!
- Your done!

Found bugs:

- If both players pick the same skills it will double the amount of skills to pick from when it's a players turn
- If a player uses a buff, then while that buff is persisting the other player uses the same buff, it will cause the original players buff to increment instead of giving the other player the buff

That should be about it! Thank you for checking out my project and I hope you have fun!

P.S. All the options you can pick from when in the game can be picked either by name or by the number next to them!
